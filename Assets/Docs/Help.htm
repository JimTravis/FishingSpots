<h1>Fishing Spots</h1>
<p>The Fishing Spots app is a diary that enables you to keep track of where you fish. You can save the geographic location of your favorite spots so that you can easily find them later. Each time you fish at a spot, you can check in and keep a record of what you caught and how you caught it.</p>

<h2>Key concepts</h2>
<p>Fishing Spots uses the following concepts:</p>
<p><b>Spots</b>:  geographic locations that are saved by using their latitudes and longitudes.</p>
<p><b>Check-ins</b>: represent visits to fishing spots. Each time you fish at a spot, you should check in and record what happened. This helps you to build up a record of what works, what doesn't, and where.</p>
<p><b>Map:</b> provides a visual representation of a location. The map represents spots by using pushpins.</p>
<p><b>Pushpins:</b> appear on the map as red flags to show a saved spot. A pushpin will show the name that you've given the spot and its current rating.</p>
<p><b>Rating</b>: represents your subjective opinion of the quality of a check-in or spot. A spot's rating is computed by averaging the ratings that you assign to its check-ins.</p>
<p><b>Species</b>: represent types of fish that like to catch.</p>
<p><b>Baits</b>: represent the various lures and live baits that you use.</p>
<p><b>Bait colors</b>: represent, well, you know.</p> 
<p><b>Rigs</b>: represent the types of rigs you use to attach your hooks or lures to the line.</p> 
<p><b>Tracking</b>: follows your location as you move. When tracking is enabled, the map view will update periodically to keep your position centered in the viewable area of the map. You might want to shut off tracking
if you're using the map to find a particular location. Otherwise, the map might periodically reset to your current position when you don't want it to.</p>

<h2>About location services</h2>
<p>Fishing Spots requires your permission to access the location services provided by your phone. If you decline to give permission when prompted, the app simply closes.</p>
<p>If you give permission to use location services and then turn off location in the phone's settings page, Fishing Spots will notify you that location services have been disabled. The net effect is:</p>
<ul>
    <li>  You won’t be able to track your location in the map.</li>
    <li>  The spot page won’t be able to provide your current location if you try to add a spot.</li>
    <li>  Other features should work normally.</li>
</ul> 




<h2>Adding spots</h2> 
<p>You can add a spot by:</p>


    
<p>You must provide a spot name. You can touch the camera button on the appbar to take a photo of a landmark near the spot. When you accept the photo, it is added as a thumbnail on the spot page. Tap the thumbnail to see the full-size photo.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>:  When you take photos in Fishing Spots, the app saves a copy of the photo to your Cameral Roll. If you don't want to keep the copy in the Camera Roll, it's okay to delete it. The app also keeps its own copy of the photo which will only be deleted if you delete the spot.</p>
<ul>
    <li>  In map view, on the appbar, tap the + sign. The spot page opens and sets the latitude and longitude to your current location. Provide a name for the spot and an optional description.</li>
    <li>  On the map, touch and hold a location. The spot page opens and sets the latitude and longitude to the location you touched. For greater accuracy, pinch-and-zoom the map to show more detail. For example, zoom until you see that dock you always fish near.</li>
    <li>  Using either of the previous two ways, you can always edit the latitude and longitude in the spot page. For example, you might have recorded a location by using a GPS device, or you could use a website to find a particular location’s coordinates.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Checking in</h2>
<p>Once you've created a spot, you can add a checkin. </p>
<p>Display the spot page for the spot. You can do this by:</p>
<ol type="1">
    <li>  Display the spot page for the spot. You can do this by:</li>
    <ul>
    <li>  Touching the pushpin  on the map</li>
    <li>  Touching the spot in the all spots list</li>
</ul> 
    <li>  In the appbar, tap the check mark. The checkin page opens.</li>
    <li>  Fill in all the details in the checkin page. Be sure to rate the checkin!</li>
	<li>  You can add photos to the checkin. You can do that by using the camera, or add them later by choosing photos from your camera roll.</li>
    <li>  Tap save.</li>
</ol> 
<p><b>Note</b>: You must provide values for all the numeric inputs, such as water depth or temperature.</p>
<p>Each checkin represents one species of fish. If you've caught different species, simply create another checkin for the new species. If you catch more of the same species, just add another checkin.</p>
<p>Once you've created a check-in, you cannot edit it. If you want to change the checkin, view the checkin, tap delete, and then create a new checkin for the spot.</p>

<h2>Viewing spots</h2>
<p>You can view your spots by:</p>
<ul>
    <li>  Tapping a pushpin on the map to view a single spot</li>
    <li>  Tapping all spots on the main hub to open the spots list. You can tap any spot on the list to see its details.</li>
</ul> 
<p>To view spots where you've caught a particular species of fish, tap the filter button on the appbar and then tap a species name. To return to the full list, tap the list button.</p>
<p>When you view a spot, you can edit the spot, delete the spot, or open a map that shows where the spot is.</p>

<h2>Viewing check-ins</h2>
<p>You can view your check-ins by:</p>
<ul>
    <li>  Tapping checkins in the pivot header of the spot page when you view an individual spot.</li>
    <li>  Tapping all checkins on the main hub to open the checkins list. You can tap any checkin to see its details.</li>
</ul> 
<p>To view checkins that you recorded on a certain date, tap the calendar button. You can tap any highlighted day to see the list of checkins on that date. To return to the full list, tap the list button.</p>
<p>When you view a checkin, you can tap the delete button to permanently delete it.
</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>
<p>On the settings page, you can:</p>
<ul>
    <li>  Revoke permission for location services. Tap the check box to deselect it. When you revoke permissions, the app will prompt you again for permission when you try to use the map. If you decline, the app closes.</li>
    <li>  Sign into Microsoft SkyDrive. You must have a SkyDrive account to backup or restore the data in your app.</li>
    <li>  Backup the database and photos. The app's files will be uploaded to a folder on SkyDrive.</li>
    <li>  Recover the database and photos. The app will download the backed-up files from SkyDrive.</li>
    <li>  Edit the lists that you use when creating a check-in. Tap the ellipsis on the appbar to see the following items:</li>
	<ul>
    <li>  edit species</li>
    <li>  edit baits</li>
    <li>  edit bait colors</li>
    <li>  edit rigs</li>
</ul> 
</ul> 
<b><font color="#FF0000">We highly recommend that you back up on a regular basis.</font></b> 
<h2>A note about pictures </h2>
<p>When you use the camera to take a picture, the app stores two copies of the picture. One copy is stored in your camera roll. The other copy is stored separately by the app. This means that if you delete the 
copy in the camera roll, the app still maintains its copy. However, photos that the app backs up to SkyDrive are downsized to a maximum width or length of 2048 pixels. If you want to keep high-resolution copies
of your photos, don't delete the camera roll copies.</p>
