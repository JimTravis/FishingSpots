# ReadMe for FishingSpots app

FishingSpots is a Windows Phone 8.1 app. The app is a geolocation-enabled fishing diary. Users can make a record of their
fishing trips and then use the app to review what happened in the past and find their way back to productive spots. (No nav
is included as the phone's nav system doesn't support navigating waters, afaik.)
